# 🎨 UI Describer – Intelligent Screenshot UI Analyzer  

## 🚀 Overview  
**UI Describer** is an AI-powered web app that provides detailed, professional-grade analyses of website UI screenshots.  
Just upload a screenshot, and the app instantly generates a **concise yet descriptive UI/UX review** — covering layout, color scheme, typography, navigation, visual hierarchy, and more.  

It’s like having a **world-class UI/UX designer and performance auditor** in your browser 🧠✨  


## 💡 Why This Project Matters

- 📊 View layout, color, typography, and structure breakdowns  
- 🚀 Integrated with **Google PageSpeed API** for real-time performance data

**UI Describer** actually *understands and evaluates* visual interfaces and performance metrics.

🎯 **Key Differentiators:**  
- 🖼️ Accepts real screenshots for design analysis  
- 🧠 Provides structured, human-like UI insights  
- 📈 Uses **Google PageSpeed Insights API** for live performance scoring
